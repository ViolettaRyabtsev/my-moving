      <h4>
        Viking Moving and Relocation is a full service moving company based in
        Southern California and serving all of California along with dozens of
        other cities within the United States. Viking's business model is based
        on two quite simple yet infinitely important concepts: customer service
        and quality. Our goal and objective is to provide you with the absolute
        best, quickest and most efficient (and least stressful!) moving
        experience possible and in our years of business, we can honestly say
        that we have exceeded our goals! We are absolutely certain that once you
        have spoken with us and decide to entrust your moving needs to us, you
        will agree and join hundreds of others who we have had the good fortune
        to work for! <br></br>The cost for many local moves is based on an
        hourly system and is generally the best and most economic way for our
        customers. Other moves in larger apartments and homes or challenging
        obstacles like multiple stairs, floors, or large amounts of furniture
        are subject to flat-rates. This is were we have an assessor come to your
        home, meet you and preform a 10-15 minute walk-through and at the
        conclusion, tell you exactly how much your move will cost and discuss
        strategies with you in terms of helping you in the most efficient way
        possible so you move is as easy and streamlined as can be. <br></br>We
        do have surcharges for unusually heavy or large items (see Piano and
        Safe section of website), but for most homes, this does not apply. But
        please do let us know if you have an unusually heavy or large piece of
        furniture so we can come prepared.
